# Module 2: Advanced Prompting Techniques

## Module Objective
Master advanced prompting techniques that enable software engineers to obtain more precise, reasoned, and reliable responses for complex development problems.

## Lessons

### Lesson 2.1: Few-Shot Prompting for Engineers
**Description:** Techniques for providing representative examples that guide the model toward the desired response pattern, with specific applications in engineering tasks.

**Content:**
- Principles of learning by examples in LLMs
- Strategic selection of representative examples
- Optimal structure of examples (input-output pairs)
- Ideal number of examples according to task complexity

**Practical Exercise:** 
Design prompts with gradual examples to teach an LLM to generate functions with specific code style and standardized documentation. Implement in OpenAI API with different quantities of examples to analyze the impact on response quality and consistency.

### Lesson 2.2: Chain-of-Thought Prompting
**Description:** Techniques to induce step-by-step reasoning in models, especially useful for algorithmic and complex logic problems.

**Content:**
- Fundamentals of explicit step-by-step reasoning
- Structuring prompts to induce CoT
- Combining CoT with few-shot learning
- Applications in debugging and algorithmic problem solving

**Practical Exercise:** 
Develop prompts that induce step-by-step reasoning to solve an algorithmic optimization problem, comparing results with and without CoT. Implement in Claude and analyze the quality of reasoning and final solution.

### Lesson 2.3: Tree-of-Thought and Solution Exploration
**Description:** Extension of Chain-of-Thought that allows exploring multiple reasoning paths in parallel for problems with high uncertainty.

**Content:**
- Differences between linear CoT and branched ToT
- Designing prompts for multiple solution exploration
- Evaluation and pruning techniques for reasoning branches
- Applications in architecture design and technical decision-making

**Practical Exercise:** 
Create a prompt that generates multiple architectural approaches for a distributed system, evaluating pros and cons of each approach. Implement in Gemini API, using Python code to process and visualize the resulting decision tree.

### Lesson 2.4: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Technique
**Description:** Methodology that combines explicit reasoning with concrete actions, ideal for tasks requiring planning and execution.

**Content:**
- ReAct prompt structure: Thought, Action, Observation
- Simulation of reasoning and action cycles
- Applications in debugging, testing, and automation
- Limitations and practical considerations

**Practical Exercise:** 
Design a ReAct prompt to debug a code fragment with errors, guiding the model through the process of identification, analysis, and correction. Implement in ChatGPT and document the reasoning process and proposed actions.

### Lesson 2.5: Self-Consistency and Result Verification
**Description:** Techniques for models to verify and correct their own responses, increasing reliability in critical tasks.

**Content:**
- Self-verification and validation prompts
- Multiple generation and voting techniques
- Detection and correction of logical inconsistencies
- Applications in secure and robust code generation

**Practical Exercise:** 
Implement a two-stage prompt system: code generation and self-verification of security and efficiency. Use OpenAI API to generate multiple solutions and apply voting techniques to select the most consistent and correct one.

### Lesson 2.6: Prompt Chaining and Sequencing
**Description:** Methodology for decomposing complex problems into manageable subtasks, processed sequentially by the model.

**Content:**
- Principles of complex problem decomposition
- Designing prompt chains with dependencies
- Context management between sequential prompts
- Programmatic implementation of prompt chains

**Practical Exercise:** 
Develop a prompt chain to transform a business requirement into technical specifications, API design, and finally implemented code. Use multiple platforms (Gemini for specifications, Claude for design, and OpenAI for implementation) and analyze how information flows between stages.
