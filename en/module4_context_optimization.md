# Module 4: Context Management and Prompt Optimization

## Module Objective
Develop advanced techniques for efficiently managing LLM context limitations and optimizing prompts to achieve higher quality results with reduced resource consumption.

## Lessons

### Lesson 4.1: Understanding and Managing Context Windows
**Description:** Strategies for working efficiently within the token limitations of different language models.

**Content:**
- Comparative analysis of context windows across different LLMs
- Token estimation and optimization techniques
- Strategies for dividing problems that exceed context windows
- Methods for maintaining coherence across multiple interactions
- Context persistence and state management patterns

**Practical Exercise:** 
Develop a methodology for processing extensive technical documents that exceed context windows, dividing analysis into coherent sections. Implement using OpenAI API with Python code to automatically manage segmentation and result consolidation.

### Lesson 4.2: Information Compression and Summarization Techniques
**Description:** Methods for condensing information while maintaining essential elements for effective LLM processing.

**Content:**
- Progressive and hierarchical summarization prompts
- Key information extraction techniques
- Semantic vs. syntactic compression methods
- Strategies for preserving technical context in summaries
- Multi-level abstraction and detail management

**Practical Exercise:** 
Design a cascading prompt system to summarize extensive technical documentation while maintaining critical implementation details. Use Claude to generate summaries at different detail levels and evaluate preservation of essential information.

### Lesson 4.3: Prompt Optimization for Efficiency and Precision
**Description:** Techniques for refining prompts that maximize response quality while minimizing resource consumption.

**Content:**
- Token economy and clarity principles
- Redundancy and ambiguity elimination techniques
- Critical information prioritization methods
- A/B testing strategies for prompt optimization
- Performance metrics and quality measurement frameworks

**Practical Exercise:** 
Perform iterative optimization of a complex code generation prompt, measuring response quality and token consumption at each iteration. Implement using Gemini API and document efficiency and precision improvements.

### Lesson 4.4: Memory and State Management in Technical Conversations
**Description:** Strategies for maintaining and managing relevant information throughout extensive conversations with LLMs.

**Content:**
- Periodic context reminder techniques
- Selective information update strategies
- Methods for maintaining consistency in technical decisions
- Dependency management between different solution components
- Conversation state persistence and recovery

**Practical Exercise:** 
Design an extensive technical conversation for incremental system development with explicit mechanisms to maintain coherence in architectural decisions. Implement in ChatGPT and evaluate solution consistency across multiple interactions.

### Lesson 4.5: Information Retrieval and Reference Techniques
**Description:** Methods for LLMs to efficiently access and utilize previously provided or generated information.

**Content:**
- Information structuring for easy retrieval
- Indexing and cross-referencing techniques
- Prompts for selective activation of prior knowledge
- Strategies for verifying consistency with previous information
- External memory systems and knowledge base integration

**Practical Exercise:** 
Develop a prompt system that allows the model to maintain and reference an incremental technical knowledge base during distributed system design. Use Claude API with an "external memory" approach managed through Python code.

### Lesson 4.6: Context Switching and Multi-Domain Management
**Description:** Advanced techniques for managing conversations that span multiple technical domains or require different expertise levels.

**Content:**
- Domain-specific context activation and deactivation
- Expertise level adaptation based on conversation needs
- Cross-domain knowledge transfer and integration
- Context boundaries and isolation strategies
- Multi-perspective analysis coordination

**Practical Exercise:** 
Create a context management system that can seamlessly switch between different technical domains (frontend, backend, DevOps, security) while maintaining relevant context for a full-stack application development project. Evaluate context efficiency and domain expertise quality.
