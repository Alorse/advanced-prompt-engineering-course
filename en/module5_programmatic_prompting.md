- Fallback strategies across different providers
- Latency and throughput optimization in integrations
- Design patterns for resilient AI-powered systems

**Practical Exercise:** 
Implement a Python abstract class that encapsulates multiple LLM APIs with automatic fallback, provider-specific error handling, and performance metrics. Include comprehensive unit tests and technical documentation.

### Lesson 5.2: Dynamic Template and Prompt Management
**Description:** Techniques for creating reusable, modular, and programmatically configurable prompt systems.

**Content:**

- Template validation and versioning
- Dynamic prompt composition based on context
- Variable configuration and parameter management
- Automated prompt template testing

**Practical Exercise:** 
Develop a prompt template management system with versioning, automatic validation, and A/B testing capabilities. Implement metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of different template versions in specific engineering tasks.

### Lesson 5.3: LLM Processing Pipelines
**Description:** Architecture and implementation of complex pipelines that combine multiple LLM calls to solve engineering problems.

**Content:**
- Sequential and parallel pipeline design
- State management between pipeline stages
- Caching strategies and performance optimization
