# Module 1: Prompt Engineering Fundamentals for Engineers

## Module Objective
Establish a solid foundation of fundamental prompt engineering principles and techniques from a software engineer's perspective, focusing on precision, structure, and efficiency.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1.1: Core Principles of Effective Prompting
**Description:** Analysis of essential components that make a prompt effective, emphasizing clarity, context, and specificity from a technical perspective.

**Content:**
- Anatomy of an effective prompt: instructions, context, examples, and expected format
- Specificity principle: how technical precision improves results
- Context principle: providing relevant information without overloading
- Clarity principle: logical structuring of complex requests

**Practical Exercise:** 
Compare results between basic and structured prompts for the same technical task (e.g., generating a function to process JSON data). Implement in ChatGPT and Claude to analyze response differences.

### Lesson 1.2: Role Playing and Persona Engineering Techniques
**Description:** How to define specific roles and technical personas to obtain more precise and context-appropriate responses for software development.

**Content:**
- Definition of specific technical roles (software architect, security specialist, etc.)
- Establishing experience levels and specialization areas
- Combining multiple roles for complex problems
- When and how to switch roles during technical conversations

**Practical Exercise:** 
Design prompts with different technical roles to solve a microservices architecture problem. Implement in Gemini and analyze how role affects technical depth and response approach.

### Lesson 1.3: Prompt Structuring and Formatting
**Description:** Techniques for structuring complex prompts in a way that is easily processable by LLMs, with emphasis on logical organization and delimiters.

**Content:**
- Use of delimiters to separate sections (```, ###, etc.)
- Multi-part prompt structuring
- Indentation and visual organization techniques
- Explicit output format specification (JSON, XML, Markdown, etc.)

**Practical Exercise:** 
Create a structured prompt to generate technical documentation for a REST API, specifying Markdown output format with specific sections. Implement in OpenAI API with Python code to process the response.

### Lesson 1.4: Inference Parameter Management
**Description:** Understanding and manipulation of parameters that control language model behavior during response generation.

**Content:**
- Temperature and its impact on creativity vs. precision
- Top-p (nucleus sampling) and when to use it
- Maximum tokens and planning for extensive responses
- Frequency and presence penalties

**Practical Exercise:** 
Experiment with different temperature and top-p configurations for a code generation task, documenting how they affect solution consistency and creativity. Implement through OpenAI and Claude APIs, comparing results.

### Lesson 1.5: Prompt Evaluation and Debugging
**Description:** Systematic methods for evaluating prompt effectiveness and techniques for identifying and correcting common problems.

**Content:**
- Objective and subjective evaluation criteria
- A/B testing techniques for prompts
- Identification of common failure patterns
- Iteration and refinement strategies

**Practical Exercise:** 
Develop a set of prompts for the same debugging task, evaluate results according to predefined criteria, and iteratively refine. Implement on multiple platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini) to compare responses and effectiveness.

### Lesson 1.3: Structured Prompting Methodologies
**Description:** Systematic frameworks for organizing complex technical requests, ensuring consistency and reproducibility in AI interactions.

**Content:**
- Template-based prompting for recurring engineering tasks
- Hierarchical prompt structure for complex system analysis
- Standardized formats for technical documentation requests
- Version control and iteration strategies for prompt development

**Practical Exercise:** 
Develop a standardized template for code review requests that includes context, specific criteria, and expected output format. Test with different codebases and refine based on result quality.

### Lesson 1.4: Context Engineering and Information Architecture
**Description:** Techniques for effectively organizing and presenting technical information to maximize LLM understanding and response quality.

**Content:**
- Information hierarchy and prioritization strategies
- Technical context layering for complex systems
- Balancing detail depth with prompt efficiency
- Context preservation techniques across conversations

**Practical Exercise:** 
Create a context framework for analyzing a large legacy codebase, organizing information by architectural layers, dependencies, and business logic. Evaluate effectiveness across different analysis tasks.

### Lesson 1.5: Prompt Validation and Quality Assurance
**Description:** Systematic approaches to validate prompt effectiveness and ensure consistent, high-quality outputs in engineering contexts.

**Content:**
- Metrics for evaluating prompt effectiveness in technical tasks
- A/B testing methodologies for prompt optimization
- Error pattern analysis and prompt debugging techniques
- Quality gates and validation criteria for production prompts

**Practical Exercise:** 
Implement a validation framework for prompts used in automated code generation, including syntax validation, functionality testing, and quality metrics. Document improvement strategies based on validation results.

### Lesson 1.6: Integration Patterns and Best Practices
**Description:** Foundational patterns for integrating prompt-based solutions into existing software development workflows and toolchains.

**Content:**
- Common integration patterns for development tools
- Error handling and fallback strategies
- Performance considerations and optimization techniques
- Documentation and maintenance practices for prompt-based systems

**Practical Exercise:** 
Design and implement a simple integration that adds AI-powered code explanation to a code review tool. Include error handling, performance monitoring, and user feedback collection mechanisms.
